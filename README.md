# TODO'S OR NOT TODO'S
### About
Todo's or not Todo's is an app created to help those with fast paced lives slow down and track their progress. It is a full CRUD todo app where the user can add, edit, and delete a task that includes a brief description.

For the frontend, I chose to use React/Redux Toolkit to further solidify my knowledge on state management and showcase my React skills. This application is backed by Python and Django. I chose Python because it is extremely versatile and makes it much easier to maintain code. If you would like to view the backend code as well, it is linked below.

I did face some challenges while completing this project. I ran into issues with my POST and UPDATE routes while learning and implementing Redux-Toolkit. Eventually the issues were solved and the app is now fully functioning. 

##### Future of the App
* Add a login feature so that each user can have their own unique set of todos.
* Fix an issue with the layout of the edit forms.
* Implement search bar to view past or current todos.
